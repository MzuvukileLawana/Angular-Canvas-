# Angular-Canvas-

# Used Microsoft SQL Server 2017 for Database. 
# Used Visual Studio 2017 for ASP.NET CORE WebApi. 
# Used Visual Studio Code for Angular front-end (included Angular Material and Bootstrap): npm -version = 6.9.0. 

# I have removed 'node_modules' directory. Once you open Angular app, please run 'npm install' to restore the node_modules. 

# I know this assessment was for Angular fron-end not a fullstack. I could have used in-memory database but sice I also have a knowledge of ASP.NET CORE webAPI I decided to used it.

# On the Flights+Hotels tab under 'BOOK FLIGHT', I have added a form where you can save flight booking to the Database.
